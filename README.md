## The History of Forest Fires 
### From Years 1889 to 2003
This map will show every mapped forest fire that took place in over a hundred year timespan in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. This comes with a legend showing fire severity, an infowindow for each mapped fire, and a fully functioning time slider which filters fires by a range of values. All data is hosted through CartoDB.
